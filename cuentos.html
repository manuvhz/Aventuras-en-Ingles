                <h2>The Lion and the Mouse</h2>
                <p>Once upon a time, a lion lay asleep in the forest. A little mouse came upon him unexpectedly, and in her fright and haste to get away, she accidentally ran across the lion's nose. Roused from his nap, the lion laid his huge paw angrily on the tiny creature to kill her. The poor mouse begged him, "Please let me go and some day I will surely repay you." The lion was much amused to think that a mouse could ever help him. But he was generous and finally let the mouse go.</p>
                <p>Some days later, while stalking his prey in the forest, the lion was caught in the toils of a hunter's net. Unable to free himself, he filled the air with his angry roaring. The mouse recognized the voice and quickly found the lion struggling in the net. Running to one of the great ropes that bound him, she gnawed it until it broke, and soon the lion was free.</p>
                <p>"You laughed when I said I would repay you," said the mouse. "Now you see that even a mouse can help a lion."</p>

                <h2>The Tortoise and the Hare</h2>
                <p>Once upon a time, there was a hare who was very proud of how fast he could run. He bragged about it to all the animals in the forest. Tired of his boasting, the tortoise challenged him to a race.</p>
                <p>The hare laughed and thought it was a joke. However, the tortoise insisted on racing, and they both agreed on a date.</p>
                <p>On the day of the race, the hare darted off quickly, leaving the tortoise far behind. Feeling confident, the hare decided to take a nap. Meanwhile, the tortoise kept moving slowly but steadily. When the hare woke up, he saw that the tortoise was near the finish line. The hare ran as fast as he could, but it was too late. The tortoise crossed the finish line first!</p>
                <p>The moral of the story is: Slow and steady wins the race.</p>

                <p>There was once a young shepherd who was bored as he sat on the side of a mountain, watching his flock of sheep. To amuse himself, he shouted, "Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is chasing the sheep!"</p>
                <p>When the villagers came running up the hill to help, they found no wolf. The boy laughed at the sight of their angry faces. "Don't cry wolf when there is no wolf!" they said.</p>
                <p>Later, he shouted again, "Wolf! Wolf!" and again the villagers ran to his aid. When they saw he was fooling them again, they were furious. "If you want to be taken seriously, you must not tell lies!"</p>
                <p>One day, a wolf did come. The boy cried out, "Wolf! Wolf!" but this time the villagers did not believe him. They thought it was another trick, and the wolf got away with a sheep.</p>
